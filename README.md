# 16-Bit-Vedic-Multiplier-using-FPGA
In this project, the design of 16 x 16 Vedic  Multiplier Using Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra is implemented. Also, the comparison of  maximum combinational path latency, chip area consumption, and total on-chip power of an 8- bit Vedic multiplier using Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra, an 8-bit Wallace tree multiplier, and an  8-bit Array Multiplier written in Verilog is done.
